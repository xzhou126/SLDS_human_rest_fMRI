We use 500 HCP subjects in the held-out set to fit final model for all main results reported in paper (fit_final_model.py).
K6_D10_500subjs_compact_model.pkl contains the fitted multi-level SLDS model and inferred discrete states (zs).
Inferred latent continuous states (xs) are stored separately (q_x.pkl).
